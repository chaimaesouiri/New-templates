    <p>This Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") provides Visitors and Users of Contentwriters.com (collectively, "You") with important information regarding ContentWriters' collection, storage and use of personally identifiable information.</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to personally identifiable information collected on the website(s) operated by ContentWriters on which this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively, "Website"), and does not apply to any other information collected by ContentWriters offline or through any other means.</p>

    <p>Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in the ContentWriters Terms of Service.</p>

    <h3>Requests for Registration Information</h3>

    <p>ContentWriters collects personally identifiable information from Users only when Users voluntarily provide it as part of the registration process ("Registration Information") to open an Account. ContentWriters never automatically collects any information that specifically identifies Users, such as their name, address, or e-mail address. </p>

    <p>It is the User's choice whether or not to provide Registration Information to ContentWriters, but such information is required in order for ContentWriters to provide you with services - namely, access to and/or participation in Assignments, to post Assignments and receive Writer Services, and certain other features of the Website. </p>

    <h3>Other Use of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

    <p>ContentWriters may request and use personally identifiable information from Users for purposes other than to open an Account. For example, such requests may be made to enable Users to subscribe to a newsletter, participate in surveys and promotions, receive technical support, and invite friends to register with contentwriters.com.</p>

    <p>Your personally identifiable information may be used internally within ContentWriters and its subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information in conformance with our Privacy Policy. We require that such other businesses and persons agree to comply with our Privacy Policy. For example, ContentWriters may use Your personally identifiable information internally to provide access to You and process Your contributions to projects, to understand who uses the Website, to improve the Website, to provide updates on special events, news, and announcements of interest to our Users, and to contact You for customer service, payment, and billing purposes.</p>

    <p>ContentWriters reserves the right to disclose Your personally identifiable information under limited circumstances in the event ContentWriters believes that the Website is being used to commit unlawful acts; if disclosure of Your personally identifiable information is required to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or with a court or administrative order; or will help to enforce our Terms of Service, to protect Your safety or security (including the safety and security of property that belongs to You) or to protect the safety and security of the Website or third parties.</p>

    <p>From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and Your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale. The personally identifiable information transferred as a part of the purchase or sale would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so.</p>

    <p>If at any time You decide to remove Your personally identifiable information from our database, You may do so by emailing us at . </p>

    <h3>Non-personally identifying information</h3>

    <p>Non-personally identifying information (information that does not identify any particular User) will be requested and utilized by ContentWriters to improve the services provided to Users and to market such services.</p>

    <h3>Cookies and Log Files</h3>

    <p>The Website may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of Your computer. Cookies can be used to provide You with tailored information from the Website. The cookie itself does not contain Registration Information. You can adjust your internet settings to alert You when You receive a cookie, which will give You the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. ContentWriters also records information that Your web browser sends whenever You visit any website, such as Your Internet Protocol address.</p>

    <p>The Website uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of websites. We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on the Website, such as the frequency with which our Users visit various parts of the Website. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We may collect information from use of these technical methods in a form that is personally identifiable.</p>

    <p>To protect Your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a password) to verify Your identity before granting You access to your profile or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of Your password and account information at all times.</p>

    <h3>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h3>

    <p>ContentWriters may allow advertising services companies to serve advertisements within the Website. Advertising may be based on usage, text, demographic, or other information gathered by or on behalf of ContentWriters. We cannot control the activities of advertisers and this Privacy Policy does not apply to advertisers. This Privacy Policy applies only to the Website operated by ContentWriters, and not to any other websites to which we may link.</p>

    <h3>Data Security</h3>

    <p>ContentWriters uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of Your personally identifiable information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information You provide to ContentWriters and You do so at Your own risk. Once We receive Your transmission of information, ContentWriters makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>

    <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

    <p>ContentWriters does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the Website from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 13. If You are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Website at any time or in any manner. If ContentWriters learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Website without verified parental consent, then ContentWriters will take appropriate steps to delete this information.</p>

If You are accessing the Website from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through Your continued access and use of ContentWriters, which are governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Notice, and our Terms of Service, You are transferring Your personally identifiable information to the United States and You consent to that transfer.</p>

    <h3>Effective Date</h3>

    <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of September, 2014 and will remain in effect unless changed. ContentWriters reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, and such modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting of the modified Privacy Policy on the Website.</p>
