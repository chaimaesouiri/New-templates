                            <li><strong>Google Tag Manager (Statistical Analysis of the Visits)</strong>
                                <br /><p> Our website uses the service of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (hereinafter referred to as Google Tag Manager).</p>
                                <p>Google Tag Manager provides a technical platform so as to be able to execute and jointly manage other web services and web-tracking programs by means of the so-called “Tags”. In this context, Google Tag Manager saves cookies on your computer and analyses your surfing behaviour (the so-called “tracking”) provided web-tracking tools are executed by means of the Google Tag Manager. These data sent by individual tags integrated in the Google Tag Manager are centralized, stored and processed by Google Tag Manager under a unified user interface.</p>
                                <p>Whilst using our website and if the integration of tags of Google Tag Manager is activated, data such as, in particular, your IP address and your user activities are transferred to the server of Google Ireland Limited and are processed and stored outside the European Union, e.g. in the USA.</p>
                                <p>The European Commission has noted that an appropriate data protection level can exist in the USA if the data processing company has adhered to the EU-US Privacy Shield and if the data export to the USA has been configured in a manner permitted this way.</p>

The tracking tools used in the Google Tag Manager ensure that, prior to the transfer, the IP address is anonymized by Google Tag Manager by means of the IP anonymization of the source code. This way, Google Tag Manager is enabled to record only anonymized IP addresses (so-called IP masking).
