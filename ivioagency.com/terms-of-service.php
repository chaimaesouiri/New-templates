        <p>These Terms of Service (the âTermsâ) including its appendices listed below, order form and/or any other agreement constitutes the entire agreement (âAgreementâ) between the Customer or You and SmartToDoList Oy or a SmartToDoList affiliate as set out in the Agreement (âSmartToDoListâ or âwe,â âourâ or âusâ), regarding your use of our services specified in the Terms (the software, and services are collectively referred to as the âServiceâ). Please read these Terms carefully. You may authorize your employees or other individual authorized users (collectively, âAuthorized Usersâ) to use the Service. You agree that you are fully responsible with respect to any use of the Service by an Authorized User, including any breach by an Authorized User of these Terms.</p>
        <p>The following appendices forms an inseparable part of and is governed by the terms of these Terms of Service:</p>
     
        <p>In the event of any conflicting terms in the Terms and its appendices, the Terms shall take precedence over the appendices, except in any matters relating to the processing of personal data, in which case Annex 1 (Data Processing Agreement) shall take precedence.</p>
        
        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. The Service</h4>
       
        <p>The Service is an analytics and reporting solution that helps customers collect their online data for reporting, analysis and active data management. The Service is provided only electronically through user interfaces on third party platforms, for example through an add-in or add-on functionality, and through interfaces hosted by SmartToDoList.</p>
        
        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Eligibility</h4>
        <p>The Service is not intended for users that are consumers (being an individual acting primarily for purposes other than a trade, business or profession) and the applicability of consumer protection legislation is therefore excluded. You must be 18 years of age or older to enter into this agreement and use the Service. You represent and warrant that any information you submit is true and accurate and that you are 18 years of age or older and are fully able and competent to enter into, and abide by these Terms, and that you have the authority to bind the Customer entity listed on the Agreement, if applicable.</p>
        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Account Registration</h4>
        <p>All Authorized Users must register to use the Service. You agree to, and cause all Authorized Users to: (a) provide accurate, current and complete information as may be prompted by registration forms on the Service (â<strong>Registration Data</strong>â); (b) maintain the security of, and not share with any third party, any logins, passwords, or other credentials that you or any Authorized User selects or that are provided to you or any Authorized User for use on the Service; (c) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data, and any other information you or any Authorized User provides to us, and to keep all such information accurate, current, and complete; and (d) notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of any Authorized User account or any other breach of security by emailing us Any activity on an Authorized Userâs account shall be the sole responsibility of the Customer.</p>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Free Trial</h4>

        <p>We may at our sole discretion offer you free trials for selected features of the Service or a limited time trial period of the entire Service. Once your free trial period ends, your ability to access the Service will terminate. SmartToDoList reserves the right to determine if you are eligible for a free trial and to discontinue any free trial without notice at our sole discretion.</p>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Fees and payment</h4>

        <p>Access to selected features of the Service may be provided to you free of charge. We will charge fees for certain features, either on a one-time or a subscription basis (âPaid Servicesâ). SmartToDoList reserves the right to implement fees or change the fees at any time by providing you notice on the Service or otherwise. If you have signed an order form with SmartToDoList for Paid Services and the subscription is automatically renewable, SmartToDoList reserves the right to increase the fees by eight (8) % annually, which shall apply at each renewal date of subscription. When you purchase any Paid Services, you authorize SmartToDoList or its third party payment processors to charge the credit card identified by you (which you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use) all applicable fees for your purchase, including all applicable taxes, and you agree that our payment provider can store your credit card information. If SmartToDoList does not receive payment from your credit card provider, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand and SmartToDoList may suspend your access to the Services until full payment is received or terminate the Terms of Service. All sales are final and SmartToDoList will not issue refunds, including for prepaid monthly fees. If you choose an automatic recurring payment and later decide to end your subscription, cancelling the payment is your responsibility. SmartToDoList does not refund automatic payments not cancelled in time.</p>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">6. Access; Use Restrictions</h4>
 
        <p>SmartToDoList hereby grants you the right to access and use the Service, subject to your compliance with these Terms at all times, including timely payment of all applicable fees.&nbsp; Your right to access and use the Service is personal, limited to your internal business purposes, non-transferable, non-exclusive, and revocable. With the tools provided by SmartToDoList, you may create additional connectors to the Service (âCustom Connector(s)â), which you may use solely with the Service to support your permitted use of the Service.</p>

        <p>Your access and use of the Service are based on the Service client, data source, data destination and usage restrictions. Access and use may be restricted to one individual, company, your SmartToDoList team or specific data access/usage. There may be additional restrictions, which may change from time to time, and we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of impending changes in a timely manner. Specific written agreements for access and usage restrictions will be indicated in the Agreement and they will override these Terms.</p>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">7. Third-party services, data and content</h4>

        <p>7.1 The Service allows you to gather data from multiple third-party data sources and services, including various third-party websites (jointly â<strong>Third-Party Services</strong>â). The Third-Party Services from which the data can be gathered are selected by SmartToDoList at its sole discretion and SmartToDoList may, during the Term, change the Third-Party Services that are compatible with the Service. In addition, SmartToDoList may discontinue the compatible Third-Party Services if the applicable service providers of the Third-Party Services discontinue the relevant services or discontinue making such services available to SmartToDoList. If you create Custom Connectors to access third-party services of your choice (âCustom Connector Servicesâ), you shall be solely liable for accessing such Custom Connector Services. SmartToDoList shall have a right to discontinue your use of Custom Connector Services, if you breach the terms of this Agreement.</p>

        <p>7.2 SmartToDoList assumes no liability whatsoever for the data or other content collected from Third-Party Services, such as Facebook, Google Analytics and Google Ads or from Custom Connector Services. You are solely responsible for ascertaining that you have the right to use the Service for gathering and processing any such data by using the Service, and you must obtain any such consents and authorizations as may be needed from time to time in relation to such data or other content and their processing by using the Service. We do not assume any liability for such Third-Party Services, Custom Connector Services or software, and you are exclusively responsible for obtaining any necessary licenses or consents needed for their use. You must familiarize yourself with the applicable terms and conditions, including any restrictions on use, in relation to any such Third-Party Services and Custom Connector Services and you agree to comply with the third-party terms and conditions applicable to the Third-Party Services and Custom Connector Services in addition to the terms of the Agreement.</p>

        <p>7.3 Furthermore, the Service may contain links to web pages and content of third parties as a service to those interested in this information. We do not monitor, endorse, or adopt, or have any control over any third-party web pages or content. We undertake no responsibility to update or review any such web pages or third-party content and can make no guarantee as to its accuracy or completeness. Additionally, if you follow a link or otherwise navigate away from the Service, please be aware that these Terms will no longer govern. You should review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any web page, third-party content or service provider to which you navigate from the Service. You access and use third-party content at your own risk.</p>

        <p>7.4With respect to Google services, our tools will only have rights to access your Google Analytics/Ads/YouTube data (depending on which service you are logging in to), and nothing else on your Google account. You can revoke SmartToDoListâ right to access your data at any point from your Google account control panel (<a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions">https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions</a>).</p>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">8. Modifications to the Service</h4>

        <p>You acknowledge that SmartToDoList may make modifications to the Service during the Term without prior notice to you; however, SmartToDoList will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any material changes to the Service in advance.&nbsp; In the event of material changes to the Service, SmartToDoList may provide further instructions to you with respect to any actions required by you in order to continue access and use of the Service, if necessary.</p>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">9. Subcontractors</h4>

        <p>SmartToDoList may engage subcontractors to perform the Service under the Agreement, provided that SmartToDoList remains fully liable for any actions of such subcontractors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SmartToDoList shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of any of its hosting service or data communication service providers.</p>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">10. Term and Termination</h4>
 
        <p>10.1 Your account and subscription of the Service remains in effect unless you terminate it or unless SmartToDoList terminates your account as provided by these Terms. Your account and subscription of the Service may, depending on your choice, be automatically renewable or valid for a fixed period. If your subscription is automatically renewable, your subscription to the Service will remain in effect and will be renewed automatically at the end of each subscription period unless you terminate your subscription or we terminate it.</p>

        <p>If your subscription is made for a fixed period and/or not automatically renewable, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the agreed subscription period.</p>

        <p>Upon the termination or expiration of the Agreement, you must immediately stop using the Service.</p>

        <p>10.2 SmartToDoList may terminate this Agreement or terminate or suspend any Authorized Userâs access or use of the Service in the following circumstances:</p>

        <p>(a) If Customerâs or any Authorized Userâs continued use of the Service or Custom Connector Service may, in SmartToDoListâ discretion, result in material harm to SmartToDoList, its subcontractors, affiliates, or another customer of the Service, SmartToDoList may reasonably block or restrict Customerâs access to the Service or Custom Connector Service;.</p>

        <p>(b) if Customer or any Authorized User has (i) submitted information to the Service in violation of applicable law; (ii) accessed Custom Connector Services for which Customer or any Authorized User has no rights or in violation of the terms of such services or (iii) otherwise used the Service in breach of these Terms, including the restrictions set forth in Section 6 above;</p>
        <p>(c) any fees due by Customer remain unpaid fifteen (15) days after the applicable due date as set forth in the Agreement; or</p>

        <p>(d) if Customer commits a material breach of its obligations under the Agreement and does not remedy such breach within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of breach from SmartToDoList.</p>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">7. Sub-processors and transfers to third countries</h4>

        <p>7.1 The Customer acknowledges that SmartToDoList needs to engage other processors for carrying out specific processing activities, and that SmartToDoList wishes to deliver standard services to its customers in a consistent, secure and efficient manner. Accordingly, the DPA shall constitute a general authorization by the Customer for SmartToDoListâ use of sub-processors. SmartToDoList shall ensure that sub-processors are bound by a written agreement that require them to provide at least the level of data protection required by SmartToDoList under this DPA. SmartToDoList shall inform the Customer of changes concerning its sub-processors, including the identity and location of new or replaced sub-processors. A list of sub-processors (including their name, country, processing activities and country/area where processing activities are carried out) is available at SmartToDoList web page or other location as designated by SmartToDoList from time to time.

        <p>7.3 If the Customer has a reasonable objection to any new or replacement sub-processor, it shall notify SmartToDoList of such objection in writing within ten (10) days of the notification.

        <p>7.4 SmartToDoList and its sub-processors may transfer or process personal data outside the EU/EEA area.</p>

        <p>7.5 When transfer of personal data by SmartToDoList to a sub-processor outside the EU/EEA, is permitted as stated above, in case of any transfer SmartToDoList shall ensure that transfer is only made to (a) a country deemed by the Commission to have an adequate level of protection, (b) entities having entered into the EU Commission standard contractual clauses approved by the European Union concerning the transfer of personal data to outside the EU/EEA or provided other appropriate safeguards as described in Article 46 of the GDPR.</p>

        <p>7.6 Subject to the above and subject to SmartToDoList keeping the Customer informed of any transfer of personal data outside the EU/EEA, the Customer gives its consent to the transfers and authorizes SmartToDoList to conclude processor to processor standard contractual clauses based on the European Commission Decision 2021/915 of 4 June 2021 to transfer Personal Data to processors located outside the EU/EEA.</p>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">8. Retention of your data</h4>

        <p>SmartToDoList has no obligation to store and SmartToDoList will not store any of Customerâs data after the termination of your account and/or subscription of the Service.&nbsp; SmartToDoList will, at Customerâs election, promptly delete or return all personal data related to Customerâs account after the end of the provision of the Services relating to processing and delete existing copies unless applicable legislation requires storage of the personal data.</p>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">9. Audit</h4>

        <p>9.1 SmartToDoList shall upon the Customerâs request make available to the Customer all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this DPA and the GDPR.</p>

        <p>9.2 The Customer or an auditor authorized by the Customer (however, not a competitor of the SmartToDoList) is entitled to audit the activities pursuant to the DPA. The Parties shall agree on the time of the auditing and other details ahead of time and at latest 30 days before the inspection. The auditing shall be carried out in a way that does not impede the obligations of SmartToDoList or its subcontractors in regard to third parties. The representatives of the Customer and the auditor must sign conventional non-disclosure commitments. The Customer shall be responsible for its own and SmartToDoListâ expenses caused by the auditing. If notable defects are perceived during auditing, SmartToDoList shall be liable for the costs incurred from remediating said defects.</p>
 
        <p>9.3 . Provided that the parties have an applicable Non-Disclosure Agreement in place, SmartToDoList reserves the right to provide the Customer with a copy of a third-party certification or report in lieu of an onsite audit as described in 9.2 above. In the event the customer does not find all reasonably needed info from the report, then 9.2. will apply.</p>

        <h4 class="wp-block-heading">10. Damages</h4>

        <p>SmartToDoList shall compensate the Customer for damages incurred by the Customer as a result of fault or negligence by SmartToDoList, or by a sub-contractor to SmartToDoList, in the processing of personal data in breach of the Agreement or this DPA, including for claims by data subjects or a supervisory authority against the Customer caused directly by SmartToDoListâ breach of this DPA.</p>

        <p>To clarify, the limitations of liability set forth in Section 19 of the Agreement shall apply.</p>
