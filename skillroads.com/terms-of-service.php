                            Follow-up letters (hereinafter “Document(s)”), and other types of written assignments in the sphere of career development.</p>

                        <p>You can place a binding order on the Website pursuant to and upon completion of all the procedures prescribed on the Website for ordering
                            the Document and registration of your Client Profile. You must give us, including but not limited to, accurate and complete information
                            about your order, email and/or contact details. As part of the ordering process, you are also required to fill in the questionnaire
                            provided on the Website with your personal career and education information.</p>

                        <p>We shall only use the materials and/or information you provide to us. All information provided must be accurate and up to date. We shall
                            not be liable for any inaccuracies in the Documents produced where such inaccuracies are a result of the materials and/or information
                            you have provided. You are solely responsible for any possible consequences and misunderstandings, in case you provide us with
                            inaccurate and/or incorrect and/or unfaithful information.</p>

                        <p>Any revision request or complaint in regards to a human-written Document that We have provided must be made within the revision period
                            (“Revision Period”). We offer a 30-day Revision Period. Revision Period begins on the date of your order deadline and expires on the
                            last day of the Revision Period. After that point, no revision and/or complaint will be accepted.</p>

                        <p>In case a request for revision is not submitted within the Revision Period, We tacitly accept that you are satisfied with the Document
                            and require no further actions to be taken in regards to the Document unless extra payment is provided or a new order is placed.</p>

                        <p>Upon receiving your completed assignment, you are entitled to a free revision guarantee should the Document fail to meet your initial
                            instructions or the defined requirements, that should be sent before the writer started working on your Document. Any changes from the
                            initial instructions of the order will be considered as “Editing”. This is another service and it requires extra payments.</p>

                        <p>When this is the case, you are entitled to request as many revisions as may be required to make the Document consistent and compliant
                            with your instructions. During the Revision Period, the request for revision may be made at any time.</p>

                        <p>We will issue a refund to you only according to these Terms. We offer a 30-day money-back period. Refund Period begins on the date of
                            your order deadline and expires on the last day of the Refund Period. In case you are not satisfied with any of the Services, you can
                            submit a refund request according to these Terms within the Refund Period.</p>

                        <p>If the order is not completed and/or the Document is not downloaded or delivered in its complete form by or to you within the set
                            deadlines, the full refund is issued at any time. In the event of order cancellation, the funds will be debited back only to the account
                            of the initial payment within 5-7 business days from the time of cancellation request.</p>

                        <p>In other cases, We assess refund requests on a case-by-case basis as there are usually unique reasons as to why a refund request is made.
                            Please note that if you request a refund, we may require documented proof that the quality of your order is low (e.g., scan copy of your
                            instructor’s feedback, plagiarism report, etc.). Should you feel it necessary to make a refund request, we will immediately forward your
                            order to our Quality Assurance Department. After comparing their findings with the reasons for dissatisfaction, the necessary corrective
                            actions will be taken. Any refund request must be made within the Refund Period.</p>

                        <p>In case, We reimburses the money because of mistakes or some irrelevance to the initial instructions, our Quality Assurance Department,
                            at its sole discretion, evaluates the quality of the Document during 5 business days, and refunds an amount comparable to the percentage
                            of incorrect content in the Document and mistakes present in it.</p>

                        <p>A full refund may be issued in cases when:</p>

                        <p>a) the order was placed by mistake (identical orders, duplicate payment, etc.) and our writer hasn’t started working on it;</p>

                        <p>b) we are not able to assign the proper expert to the order and, thus, cannot deliver the service;</p>

                        <p>c) you do not need the document anymore because the deadline has passed, but you were not provided with any drafts from our side.</p>

                        <h2>Payment and fee policy</h2>

                                more future transactions. An example of such transaction is an account auto-top up transaction.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p style="text-decoration:underline">Can these terms change?</p>

                        <h2>Verification </h2>
                        <p>We may require you to supply us with personal identifying information, and we may also legally consult other sources to obtain
                            information about you. By accepting these Terms and Conditions, you authorize us to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate
                            the information that you provide us with. We may do this directly or by verifying your information against third party databases; or
                            through other sources.</p>

                        <p>Essentially, verification procedure involves, inter alia, confirming that the order is authentic and that the cardholder is aware of
                            charges by placing a phone call to them, and in certain cases by requesting some additional documents to be submitted for verification
                            to our Risk Department. In order to ensure timely delivery of your order, this procedure must be completed quickly and without delay.
                            Therefore, it is vital to provide accurate and valid phone numbers. Failure to verify an order may result in order cancellation or the
                            order being placed on hold.</p>

                        <p>You consent to our processing your personal information for the purposes of providing the Services, including for verification purposes
                            as set out herein. You also consent to the use of such data for communicating with you, for statutory and accounting purposes. You
