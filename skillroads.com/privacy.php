                        </p>

                        <p>1. You have the right to access information about you, specifically:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>the categories of data;</li>

                        <p>3. You can object to the Company using your personal data to profile you or make automated decisions about you. The Company may use your
                            data to determine whether we should let you know the information that might be relevant to you (for example, tailoring emails to you
                            based on your behavior).
                        </p>
                        <p>4. You have the right to the data portability and can transfer your data to another service or Website. The Company will give you a copy
                            of your data in a readable format so that you can provide it to another service. If you ask us, and it is technically possible, we will
                            directly transfer the data to the other service for you.
                        </p>

                        <p>5. You have the right to be “forgotten.” You may ask erasing any personal data about you if it is no longer necessary for the Company to
                            store the data for purposes of your use of the Website.</p>

                        <p>6. You have the right to complain about the use of your data by the Company. In the context of the right to access information, the
                            Company shall provide you with the information within one month of your request unless there is a justified requirement to provide such
                            information faster.</p>

                        <h2>10. Security</h2>

                        <p>We have security and organizational measures and procedures to protect the data collected and stored. We have security policies and data
                            processing agreements with all our employees and contractors who are obliged to follow and maintain appropriate technical and
                            organizational measures. We have an internal Information Security Policy.</p>

                        <p>Connections to the Website are encrypted using 256-bit SSL with integrity assured by the SHA2 ECDSA algorithm.</p>

                        <p>We use servers that comply with strict international data security standards, including ISO 27001.</p>

                        <p>We use servers that are certified under PCI DSS Level 1, ISO/IEC 27001:2013, SOC 1 Type II.</p>

                        <p>You acknowledge that no perfect security infrastructure exists, no data transmission is guaranteed to be 100% secure, and there may be
                            some security risks.</p>

                        <p>You are responsible for your login information and password. You shall keep them confidential.
                        </p>

                        <p>In case if your privacy has been breached, please contact the Company immediately at <a href="mailto:info@<?=$ihost?>">info@<?=$ihost?></a>.</p>

                        <h2>11. Location of data processing facilities</h2>

                        <p>The personal data collected by the Company is processed at the Company’s offices. The Company is international and can have foreign
                            branches and departments. The Company’s Research and Development department is based on secure premises. The employees and contractors
                            of the Company’s Research and Development department are bound by the respective agreements, Company’s internal policies and Information
                            Security Policy.</p>

                        <h2>12. Right to Request Deletion</h2>

                        <p>You have the right to request that the Company delete any of your personal data that the Company collected about you and retained. The
                            Company will delete your personal data from our records once the Company receives your request and verifies your personality.
                        </p>

                        <h2>13. Transfer of your personal data</h2>

                        <p>The Company has departments outside the EEA, mainly the Company’s Research and Development department is based in Ukraine. Therefore,
                            some data the Company collects from you will be processed in Ukraine. Ukraine has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from
                            the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR.</p>

                        <p>The Company relies on derogations for specific situations, as outlined in Article 49 of the GDPR. In particular, the Company collects and
                            transfers to Ukraine personal data only: with your consent, to perform a contract with you, or to fulfill a compelling legitimate
                            interest of the Company in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. The Company endeavors to apply suitable safeguards
                            to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with the Company and the
                            practices described in this Privacy Policy. The Company also minimizes the risk to your rights and freedoms by not collecting or storing
                            sensitive information about you.</p>
