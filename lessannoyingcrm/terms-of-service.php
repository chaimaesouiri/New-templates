            <p><strong><em>Terms of Service Summary:</em></strong><em> Here&#x27;s an attempt at briefly and concisely summarizing some key points of these Terms of Service in non-legal-jargon.</em></p>
            <ul role="list">
                <li>You acknowledge that we cannot, unfortunately, guarantee that everything will go totally smoothly all the time.</li>
                <li>You are responsible for using our system in a responsible manner, including uploading only data you should be uploading, abstaining from malicious or illegal behavior, protecting your password, respecting the integrity of the system, and respecting its users and its creators (that’s us!).</li>
                <li>After your trial, you’ll be billed monthly. You can cancel anytime you’d like. If you cancel, your account is archived by default. You can tell us to delete your data, if you don’t want it archived.</li>
                <li>As the creators and curators of the system, we can change, add, and remove things, and we can also limit, throttle, suspend, or discontinue your account if it is deemed necessary.</li>
                <li>You are welcome to use our API, but you do so at your own risk, and your access can be throttled or terminated if it is deemed to be an abuse/overuse of the tool.</li>
                <li>If you have any questions about this stuffy document, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</li>
                <li>Remember to read below for details -- this section is not a substitute for the actual Terms of Service, just a brief summary!</li>
