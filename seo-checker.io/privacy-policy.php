                <br/><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person. In legal terms, we are generally the &#x27;data controller&#x27; under European data protection laws of the personal information described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a &#x27;data processor on behalf of our customers.

You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href="#">here</a> to learn more.
                <br/>‍
