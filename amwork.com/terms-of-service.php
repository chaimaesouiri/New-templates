                        <h4>1. Content</h4>
                        <p>Definitions: For purposes of these Terms: (i) “Content” means text, graphics, images, music, software, audio, video, works of authorship of any kind, and information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided or otherwise made available through the Service; and (ii) “User Content” means any Content that account holders (including you) provide to be made available through the Service.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Our Content Ownership: We do not claim any ownership rights in any User Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit your User Content. Subject to the foregoing, SalesLab and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Service and Content (excluding User Content), including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Service and Content are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Service or Content.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Rights in User Content Granted by You: By making any User Content available through the Service, you hereby grant to SalesLab a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, host, cache, store, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, distribute and modify (for formatting purposes only), your User Content solely in connection with operating and providing the Service and Content to you and, depending on the permission you grant, to other users. Subject to the foregoing license, as between SalesLab and you, you retain any and all of your rights to your User Content. SalesLab acknowledges that if you provide Enterprise Content (as defined below), then the ownership of such Enterprise Content may be as set forth in any agreement between you and the Enterprise, and in the absence of such agreement, then as between you and the Enterprise, the Enterprise may own all rights to any such Enterprise Content.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Your Responsibility for User Content: You are solely responsible for all your User Content. You represent and warrant that you own all your User Content or you have all rights that are necessary to grant us the license rights in your User Content under these Terms. You also represent and warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made available through the Service, nor any use of your User Content by SalesLab on or through the Service will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Sharing User Content: You may designate your User Content as “public” (such as posting User Content to a Team Workspace or Enterprise Workspace) or “private”. You agree that User Content you designate as public will be accessible by and be available to other users of the Service to whom you grant access to such publicly designated User Content. Consequently, you understand and agree that such users will have the right to view, comment on and tag your publicly designated User Content. If you grant users additional permissions with respect to your User Content, you understand and agree that such users will, depending on the permissions you grant, have the right to use, publish, display, modify, or duplicate such User Content. You grant SalesLab all rights necessary to make any of your publicly designated User Content available to other users of the Service and to permit those users to engage in the activities described in this Section with respect to your publicly designated User Content.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Removal of User Content: You can remove your User Content that you designate as private by specifically deleting it. However, some of your User Content may not be completely removed and copies of your User Content may continue to exist on the Service. Additional details with respect to the removal and storage of User Content are set forth in Section 17 (Termination) below.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Rights in Content Granted by SalesLab: Subject to your compliance with these Terms, SalesLab grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, with no right to sublicense, to download, view, copy, display and print the Content solely in connection with your permitted use of the Services and solely for your personal and non-commercial purposes.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Monitoring Content: Although we’re not obligated to monitor access to or use of the Service or Content or to review or edit any Content, we have the right to do so for the purpose of operating the Service, to ensure compliance with these Terms and to comply with applicable law or other legal requirements. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to remove or disable access to any Content, including User Content, at any time and without notice, including, but not limited to, if we, at our sole discretion, consider any Content to be objectionable or in violation of these Terms. We have the right to investigate violations of these Terms or conduct that affects the Services. We may also consult and cooperate with law enforcement authorities to prosecute users who violate the law.</p>
                        <h4>2. Workspaces</h4>
                        <p>Content submitted, posted or modified by users in the Service is organized into separated sections we refer to as “Workspaces.”</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>There are three general types of Workspaces on the Service:</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>“Personal Workspaces” that can only be accessed by the user that created the Workspace.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>“Team Workspaces” that require a Team Subscription (as defined below) and that can be accessed by multiple users that form the members of the Team. Further details on Team Workspaces are outlined below.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>“Enterprise Workspaces” that require an Enterprise Subscription (as defined below) and that are designed for large-scale usage by Enterprises who require tools managing all Enterprise Content within such Workspaces. Further details on Enterprise Workspaces are outlined below.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In the Service, you can work across multiple Workspaces at once, meaning your single account can access your own Personal Workspace(s), different Team Workspace(s), and your employer’s Enterprise Workspace. Workspaces are completely separate, and you won’t be able to link any Content between them (although you can transfer copies of Content from one Workspace to another). You can also export your User Content from your Workspaces for use outside of the Service using our export tool available in our online account management page. Note that exporting or transferring Enterprise Content from an Enterprise’s Workspace will be managed by the applicable Enterprise administrator, which may or may not allow you to use our export or transfer tools for Enterprise Content from such Enterprise’s Workspace.</p>
                        <h4>3. Subscriptions</h4>
                        <p>Some parts of the Service are made available on a paid subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). Subscriptions are available for Personal Workspaces, Team Workspaces and Enterprise Workspaces. Pricing for the Subscriptions is set forth here:https://www.saleslab.promo/tariff.</p>
                        <p>You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing Cycles are set on a monthly or yearly basis.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Auto-Renewal: You agree that at the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew and your payment method for such Subscription will automatically be charged at the start of each new Subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that Billing Cycle, under the same conditions as the prior Billing Cycle unless you cancel it or SalesLab cancels it.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You must provide SalesLab with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize SalesLab to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, SalesLab may attempt to charge the credit card on file one or more times. Should payment continue to fail, the Subscription will be cancelled.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>You may cancel your Subscription either through your online account management page or by contacting SalesLab customer support team at team@saleslab.app.</p>
                        <h4>4. Team Subscriptions and Team Workspaces</h4>
                        <p>SalesLab offers “Team Workspaces” that can be accessed by multiple team members. To create a Team Workspace, you will need to purchase a “Team Subscription”.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Team Subscriptions are charged on a per member and per Team Workspace basis. That means if the same member is accessing two different Team Workspaces, then two different Subscription fees will be charged for that user accessing both Team Workspaces. For example, if you are buying a Subscription for two separate Team Workspaces with 4 members in each Team Workspace on a monthly Team Subscription of $10 per member, that would be charged as $10 x 8 members or $80/month. If two of those members are overlapping in both Team Workspaces, that would still be charged as $80/month.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Certain sections of a Team Workspace will be designated as accessible by all members of the Team. Any User Content posted to those sections of a Team Workspace will be accessible by all members of the Team Workspace. If a member of a Team Workspace terminates the Service account or ceases to be a member of the Team Workspace, their User Content posted to those accessible sections of the Team Workspace will not be removed and will remain accessible by other member of the Team Workspace.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Members of a Team Workspace can also designate that certain sections of the Team Workspace are private only to that member. Any User Content posted by such member to the private sections of the Team Workspace will be accessible only by that member. If a member of the Team Workspace terminates their Service account or ceases to be a member of the Team Workspace, any of their User Content posted to those private sections will be removed and not accessible by any other members of the Team Workspace.</p>
                        <h4>5. Enterprise Subscriptions and Enterprise Workspaces</h4>
                        <p>SalesLab offers “Enterprise Workspaces” on the Service that are designed for use by enterprises, employers and other organizations that have multiple teams and require collaborative Workspaces with higher levels of support, controls and unlimited revision history for all pages. Enterprise Workspaces are not for personal use, but are only available to organizations (such as an employer or another business entity) or their authorized representatives.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>To create an Enterprise Workspace, the applicable organization will need to purchase an “Enterprise Subscription.” An organization that has purchased an Enterprise Subscription will be referred to herein as an “Enterprise”. An Enterprise Subscription can be purchased either directly within the Service interface (in which case their use will be governed by these Terms) or by entering into a separate service agreement, subscription agreement, order form, or similar agreement with SalesLab. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and such separate agreement with SalesLab, the terms of such separate agreement will supersede and control with respect to any use of the Enterprise Workspaces of that applicable Enterprise.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>An Enterprise may invite you to use their Enterprise Workspace or join the Service as their Enterprise User by sending you an invite link that allows you to create an account on the Service and gain access to the applicable Enterprise Workspaces.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>As stated in the “Content” section of these Terms, if you submit or post User Content to an Enterprise Workspace (such User Content, the “Enterprise Content”), then the ownership of such Enterprise Content will be as set forth in any agreement between you and the applicable Enterprise (as defined below) that manages such Enterprise Workspace, and in the absence of such agreement, then as between you and such Enterprise, the Enterprise will own all rights to any such Enterprise Content that is submitted, posted, stored or made available on its Enterprise Workspace.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>We provide an Enterprise with many other tools and controls over an Enterprise Workspace and Enterprise Content. For example, an Enterprise may access, delete, edit or export Enterprise Content; enable or disable an Enterprise User’s access to an Enterprise Workspace; grant access to Enterprise Content to third parties; enable or disable third party integrations; manage an Enterprise User’s permissions, retention and export settings; and these choices and instructions may result in the access, use, disclosure, modification or deletion of certain or all Enterprise Content.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Enterprises are authorized to add and remove users to use their unique Enterprise Workspaces. Users that have been authorized to use an Enterprise Workspace of the Service by an Enterprise are referred to as an “Enterprise User” while they are using such Enterprise Workspace. If you purchased an Enterprise Subscription on behalf of your organization or employer, your organization or employer is the Enterprise, and not you. The Enterprise can modify and re-assign roles on the Enterprise Workspace (including your role). If the Enterprise elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the Enterprise Workspace, you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or the Enterprise to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Enterprise.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>If you are using an Enterprise Workspace as an Enterprise User, then you agree that as between SalesLab and Enterprise, it is Enterprise’s responsibility to (a) inform you as an Enterprise User of any relevant Enterprise policies and practices that may impact the use and processing of your Enterprise Content; and (b) obtain any rights, permissions or consents from you as an Enterprise User that are necessary for the lawful use of your Enterprise Content. Further, if you are using an Enterprise Workspace as an Enterprise User, you acknowledge that the Service as used by you under such circumstances is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply in connection with such use of an Enterprise Workspace as an Enterprise User.</p>
                        <h4>6. Free Trial</h4>
                        <p>SalesLab may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial"). If you are on a Free Trial, you may cancel at any time until the last day of your Free Trial by following the cancellation procedures outlined in the Subscription section of these Terms. If you or SalesLab cancel your Free Trial, you acknowledge and agree that we may delete all of your User Content or data associated with the Workspace that was assigned to your Free Trial. If you do not cancel your Free Trial, then your Free Trial will be converted to a paid Subscription at the end of the trial period, and you hereby authorize us to charge your credit card or other payment method for continued use of the paid Service under such Subscription. You may then however, cancel your Subscription in accordance with the Subscription section of these Terms.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>At any time and without notice, SalesLab reserves the right to (a) modify the terms and conditions of any Free Trial offer, (b) cancel any Free Trial offer, or (c) cancel any Free Trial subscription at any time.</p>
                        <h4>7. Fees and Fee Changes</h4>
                        <p>SalesLab, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>SalesLab will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). You will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your Subscription, except for those taxes based on our net income. Should any payment for the Service be subject to withholding tax by any government, you will reimburse us for such withholding tax.</p>
                        <h4>9. Refunds</h4>
                        <p>Payment obligations are non-cancelable, and fees paid are non-refundable and there are no credits for partially used Subscription periods.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by SalesLab on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of SalesLab.</p>
                        <h4>10. Communications from SalesLab</h4>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and SalesLab will have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator. You may instead assert your claim in “small claims” court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court and your claim remains on an individual, non-representative and non-class basis.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Payment for any and all reasonable JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the JAMS Rules.</p>
                        <p>You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to team@saleslab.app or to the U.S. mailing address listed at in the Contact Us section of these Terms. The notice must be sent to SalesLab within thirty (30) days of your registering to use the Service or agreeing to these Terms, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with these Terms. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, SalesLab also will not be bound by them.</p>
