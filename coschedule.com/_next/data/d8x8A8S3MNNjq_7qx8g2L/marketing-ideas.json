Establish Your Logo &amp; Branding</h2>\n<p>As part of a healthy brand marketing strategy, establish your logo, <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/brand-asset-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brand assets</a>, and branding approach as early as possible to make a consistent impression on customers.</p>\n<p>For example, while Starbucks has tweaked its logo over the years, it still has the iconic siren, showing how far branding consistency goes in its <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-strategy-examples/starbucks-marketing-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing strategy</a>:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_165307\" style=\"width: 639px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-165307\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"drop-shadow wp-image-165307 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2022/09/40-Awesome-Marketing-Ideas-to-Grow-Your-Business-starbucks.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"629\" height=\"418\" srcset=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2022/09/40-Awesome-Marketing-Ideas-to-Grow-Your-Business-starbucks.png 629w, https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2022/09/40-Awesome-Marketing-Ideas-to-Grow-Your-Business-starbucks-300x199.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-165307\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-starbucks/starbucks-cuts-name-and-coffee-from-logo-idUSTRE7045YF20110105\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source</a></p></div>\n<h2>2. Design Your Business Cards</h2>\n<p>Make business cards to hand to clients and pass on at networking events when people don’t have time to write down your contact info. If you want folks to hold onto your business cards, use a design, shape, or paper <a href=\"https://www.creativebloq.com/features/8-great-business-cards-for-marketing-professionals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">that makes them stand out</a>.</p>\n<p>Or, you could give your business cards a practical use, like <a href=\"https://cleverbusinesscards.com/cheese-grater-business-card/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this cheese grater card</a> for Bon Vivant cheese stores:</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-165308 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2022/09/40-Awesome-Marketing-Ideas-to-Grow-Your-Business-bon-vivant.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"961\" srcset=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2022/09/40-Awesome-Marketing-Ideas-to-Grow-Your-Business-bon-vivant.png 1200w, https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2022/09/40-Awesome-Marketing-Ideas-to-Grow-Your-Business-bon-vivant-300x240.png 300w, https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2022/09/40-Awesome-Marketing-Ideas-to-Grow-Your-Business-bon-vivant-770x617.png 770w, https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2022/09/40-Awesome-Marketing-Ideas-to-Grow-Your-Business-bon-vivant-768x615.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></p>\n<h2>3. Start An Email Newsletter</h2>\n<p>Stay in touch with your customers by starting an email newsletter. It’ll keep your brand at the top of customers’ minds and build their trust if you give them <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-ideas/newsletter-ideas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">good content or deals</a>.</p>\n<p>An email newsletter doesn’t have to include only promotions or updates to succeed — check out how apéritif company Haus shares weekend inspiration <a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/your-guide-to-the-long-weekend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in its newsletter</a>:</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-165309 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2022/09/40-Awesome-Marketing-Ideas-to-Grow-Your-Business-haus.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"658\" height=\"1303\" srcset=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2022/09/40-Awesome-Marketing-Ideas-to-Grow-Your-Business-haus.png 658w, https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2022/09/40-Awesome-Marketing-Ideas-to-Grow-Your-Business-haus-151x300.png 151w, https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2022/09/40-Awesome-Marketing-Ideas-to-Grow-Your-Business-haus-517x1024.png 517w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/newsletter-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The 12 Best Newsletter Examples to Inspire Your Own</a></div>\n<h2>4.

Create Your Website</h2>\n<p>Make sure to build a website as part of your early marketing efforts.
