There are a number of different definitions that often get applied to this seemingly simple term, so it’d be best to clearly delineate how this guide defines the concept.</p>\n<div class=\"defined-term\">\n<p class=\"defined-term-name\">Marketing Strategy Definition</p>\n<p class=\"defined-term-description\">Marketing strategy describes the process of how businesses and organizations understand their markets and their methods for influencing profitable customer action.</p>\n</div>\n<p>That seems succinct enough, right? In other words, and in the interest of keeping things simple, marketing strategy is all about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understanding <strong>who buys</strong> your products and services.</li>\n<li>Understanding how you’ll <strong>motivate them</strong> to take profitable action.</li>\n<li>Understanding your <strong>competitors</strong> who are trying to do the same thing.</li>\n<li>Understanding how you’ll <strong>measure marketing activities</strong> and refine your approach moving forward.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A company’s marketing strategy is its plan for reaching potential consumers and converting them into paying customers for its goods and services. A marketing strategy includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Research:</strong> Analysis of target markets, competition, pricing triggers, buying behaviors, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Differentiation in value promises, packaging look and feel, conversion messaging, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Promotion:</strong> Actual marketing of products and services through content, relationships, and experiences with the goal of influencing profitable customer action.</li>\n<li><strong>Measurement:</strong> Proving value, learning from success and failure, and iterating future work to fulfill <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-goals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing goals</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s look at some other definitions of marketing strategy from industry experts.</p>\n<h3>Marketing Strategy Definition From Philip Kotler</h3>\n<p>Philip Kotler, one of the co-authors of the discipline-defining textbook, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Marketing-Management-Global-Philip-Kotler/dp/1292404817/ref=sr_1_1?crid=EG6UPT9TDCNJ&amp;keywords=marketing+management&amp;qid=1660677656&amp;sprefix=marketing+management%2Caps%2C212&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marketing Management</a></em>, defines <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bilOOPuAvTY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing strategy</a> as the process to:</p>\n<div class=\"quotation\">\n<p class=\"quotation-text\">Create, communicate, and deliver value to a target market at a profit.</p>\n<p class=\"quotation-name\">&#8211; Philip Kotler</p>\n</div>\n<p>Kotler goes on to say, “Creating value is called product management. […] You have to communicate value. […] That’s brand management. […] To deliver value is called customer management. […] So you’re in three businesses: product management, brand management, and customer management.”</p>\n<h3>Marketing Strategy Definition From Omer Farkash</h3>\n<p>Omer Farkash, the co-founder and COO at Mayple, <a href=\"https://www.mayple.com/blog/marketing-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">writes</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"quotation\">\n<p class=\"quotation-text\">“Marketing strategy is a long-term, forward-looking approach and an overall game plan of any organization or any business with the fundamental goal of achieving a sustainable competitive advantage by understanding the needs and wants of customers.”</p>\n<p class=\"quotation-name\">&#8211; Omer Farkash</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Marketing Strategy Definition From Adam Barone</h3>\n<p>Adam Barone, a content strategist, wrote the definition of marketing strategy for <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing-strategy.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Investopedia</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"quotation\">\n<p class=\"quotation-text\">“A marketing strategy refers to a business’s overall game plan for reaching prospective consumers and turning them into customers of their products or services. A marketing strategy contains the company’s value proposition, key brand messaging, data on target customer demographics, and other high-level elements.”</p>\n<p class=\"quotation-name\">&#8211; Adam Barone</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Marketing Strategy Definition From Noah Kagan</h3>\n<p>Noah Kagan, Founder of Sumo, told CoSchedule&#8217;s CEO, that the <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-use-growth-marketing-tests-to-10x-your-results-with-noah-kagan-from-sumo-amp-088\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">definition of marketing strategy</a> starts with a question:</p>\n<div class=\"quotation\">\n<p class=\"quotation-text\">“Do you have a product or service that people want? If you don’t have that, nothing else matters.”</p>\n<p class=\"quotation-name\">&#8211; Noah Kagan</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Importance Of Marketing Strategy</h2>\n<div class=\"list-item\">\n<p class=\"list-item-name\">Implementing a marketing strategy for your business is important because it empowers marketers to:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-item-element\">\n<li>Gain knowledge of target market, demand, and competitive differentiation that make investments in product development profitable.</li>\n<li>Provide your company with an edge over its competition with knowledge of what influences purchase decisions that can optimize product positioning.</li>\n<li>Set up marketing departments for success by defining marketing goals, lead indicators, lag indicators, and providing focus for marketers to focus their efforts on what has the best potential to influence results.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"list-item\">\n<p class=\"list-item-name\">A robust and ideal marketing strategy will:</p>\n<ol class=\"list-item-element\">\n<li>Align your <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">team</a> behind a set of <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-objectives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">objectives</a></li>\n<li>Assist you in connecting your efforts to your company’s goals</li>\n<li>Differentiate your products from the competition with unique value propositions</li>\n<li>Allow you to determine what connects with your audience and test it</li>\n<li>Empower your team to prove its value to the organization</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h2>Benefits Of A Marketing Strategy</h2>\n<p>You might be thinking your company isn’t a global powerhouse. You might not even aspire to achieve that kind of growth, and, realistically, most companies won’t or don’t need to join the Fortune 500—though even the world’s biggest brands still need to pay attention to strategy, too.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean focusing on strategy and making a real investment in it isn’t for you. If you have customers to serve, then you need to think strategically so your execution—you know, all the fun, creative parts that attract so many of us to this work in the first place—actually moves the people it needs to and drives the results you need.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-170480\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2023/01/Marketing-Strategy-benefits-success.png\" alt=\"Benefits of a successful marketing strategy \" width=\"1360\" height=\"1151\" srcset=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2023/01/Marketing-Strategy-benefits-success.png 1360w, https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2023/01/Marketing-Strategy-benefits-success-300x254.png 300w, https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2023/01/Marketing-Strategy-benefits-success-770x652.png 770w, https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2023/01/Marketing-Strategy-benefits-success-768x650.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" /></p>\n<h3>Marketers Who Document Their Strategy Are 674% More Likely To Reach Goals</h3>\n<p>“You need a documented strategy” is an old chestnut that has been repeated around the marketing industry for decades. It turns out that there&#8217;s a good reason for this, and it’s not just a commonly accepted best practice that we all do without actually knowing why.</p>\n<p>In fact, research from CoSchedule in 2022 shows that <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketers who document strategy are 674% more likely to report success</a> than their peers who do not document strategy.</p>\n<h3>Marketers Who Set Goals Are 377% More Successful</h3>\n<p>The same report that proves marketers who document strategy are more successful also found that <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketers who set goals are 377% more likely to report success</a> than their peers who do not proactively set goals.</p>\n<p>If goals are the destination, then goal-setting marketers are very good at drawing the roadmap to get where they need to be. Without a known destination, marketers are directionless… seemingly meandering with no guideposts.</p>\n<h3>Marketers Who Plan Are 331% More Successful</h3>\n<p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.prweb.com/releases/dump_the_go_with_the_flow_philosophy_in_2021_new_study_looks_at_the_benefits_of_planning_ahead/prweb17624459.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study from PsychTests.com</a> discovered that “people who plan ahead are more self-motivated, resilient, and optimistic than people who take things as they come.”<br />\n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketers who proactively plan are 331% more likely to report success</a> than their peers who do not plan ahead.</p>\n<h3>You Can Win At Marketing Strategy By Doing What Others Won’t</h3>\n<p>One last fact from CoSchedule’s research: Only 47% of marketers have documented portions of their process. Just 17% of marketers have documented the majority (if not all) of their marketing strategy.</p>\n<p>If we put these statistics together, we can loosely draw a few different conclusions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Documenting strategy matters:</strong> It’s not a pointless exercise—especially when you do it effectively.</li>\n<li><strong>Most marketers do not strategize well:</strong> This means more opportunity for you to kick ass.</li>\n<li><strong>Success requires follow-through:</strong> The door is wide open for those willing to walk through it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What Is Included In A Marketing Strategy?</h2>\n<p>A Marketing Strategy uses high-level elements to determine a company’s current value position and outline a future marketing direction. It generally contains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Marketing Outcome: The end result a company wishes to achieve</li>\n<li>A SWOT analysis: An internal and external review of an organization to determine its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout\"><strong>Recommended Reading: </strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/swot-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marketing SWOT Analysis: How To Do It (With Examples &amp; Template)</a></div>\n<ul>\n<li>The Target Audience: The ideal customer a company wants to reach</li>\n<li>A Budget: The money allocated to marketing efforts</li>\n<li>A Product Mix: The analysis of product, price, place, and promotion – the key components in successfully marketing <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">anything</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout\"><strong>Recommended Reading: </strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing/marketing-mix\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What Is The Marketing Mix?

A written plan with crucial information acts like a roadmap for marketers to travel to your desired destination—the goals you aim to influence.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Understand your target audience and the market:</span> Researching customers, market trends, and competition empowers marketers to differentiate products, pricing, distribution, promotion, packaging, and positioning. Accurate research to direct marketing efforts is essential for a marketing strategy—and team—to be successful.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Define your unique value proposition and key differentiators:</span> In this step, marketing strategists translate research into action. Marketing must influence product research and development, brand identity with visuals and voice, and unique positioning and benefits statements.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Set marketing goals and objectives:</span> After marketing strategists understand the market opportunity, they may set smart, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timely (SMART) goals.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Identify the marketing approaches and media to reach your target audience:</span> The goal of marketing is to generate profitable customer action. Marketing strategy focuses on stakeholders and practitioners by documenting marketing funnel stages, selecting the marketing tactics with the greatest potential to influence the goals and objectives, and defining the channels the organization will leverage to execute the plan.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Execute and publish marketing activities:</span> A <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-plan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing plan</a> is only beneficial when a company actualizes it. Marketing strategists must identify when campaigns will launch and how contributors will collaborate with their resources to make the vision a reality.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Measure and analyze results:</span> Marketing strategists know that if you ship but neglect to measure your impact, you haven’t achieved anything. Successful marketers measure how their activities influence the goals and objectives outlined in the marketing strategy. From there, ideation from audits may lead to tests and iterations that may be even more influential in achieving marketing goals.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-strategy-steps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read this resource for a complete and robust list of marketing strategy steps.</a></p>\n<p>So how do you develop a marketing strategy?

It can assist you in determining what may separate you from your competitors and the resources available to capitalize on that opportunity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Document Buyer Personas</h3>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-persona\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing persona</a> is a document that covers the who, what, when, where, and why of your target audience and broad demographic data such as gender, job title, job function, business size, team size, requirements, pain points, and difficulties.</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Define Your Unique Value Proposition &amp; Key Differentiators</h2>\n<h3>Identify Your Brand Value &amp; Offering</h3>\n<p>While your logo, goods, website, and even your digital marketing efforts may evolve, one constant must be your brand values. Your fundamental brand values are the principles around which you found your business.</p>\n<p>They work as a compass for your brand’s narrative, activities, behaviors, and decision-making process.</p>\n<h3>Define Your Unique Brand Voice</h3>\n<div class=\"defined-term\">\n<p class=\"defined-term-name\">Brand Voice</p>\n<p class=\"&quot;defined-term-description”\">The term <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/brand-voice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">brand voice</a> refers to the personality and emotion infused into a company&#8217;s communication. It involves the words and language you employ to the personality and image elicited by your marketing materials.</p>\n</div>\n<p>You must ensure that your message is heard above the competition and leaves a lasting impact on potential clients.</p>\n<h3>Create Your Creative Visual Identity</h3>\n<p>Your brand’s design is its unsung advocate. Now, more than ever, the visual appearance of your brand can make or break your business.</p>\n<p>Visual identity is not exclusive to large corporations; small, direct-to-consumer firms may also develop one at a modest cost. We strongly advise you to create an excellent visual identity, even if you are just getting started.</p>\n<h3>Document Your Brand Positioning &amp; Messaging</h3>\n<p>Brand positioning determines how your product is viewed, while messaging serves as a vehicle for amplifying that perception. Together, they define your company’s position in the market and ultimately determine its long-term success.</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Set Marketing Goals &amp; Objectives</h2>\n<h3>What Are Marketing Goals?</h3>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-goals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing goal</a> is a defined, quantifiable, aspirational, reasonable, and time-bound statistic that serves as the driving force behind all your marketing efforts.</p>\n<p>Marketers who document their aims and objectives are more likely to <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">see them through</a> to completion.</p>\n<h3>What Are Marketing Objectives?</h3>\n<p>Marketing objectives are quantifiable goals that define the desired outcome of your marketing approach. Their primary objective is to direct your marketing efforts toward certain milestones.</p>\n<h3>Document SMART Goals</h3>\n<p>It is critical to ensure that your marketing objectives are Specified, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound – or SMART for short. The SMART approach enables a supervisor to manage marketing activities effectively and forecast the success of new objectives.</p>\n<h2>Step 5: Identify The Marketing Approaches &amp; Media To Reach Your Target Audience</h2>\n<h3>Understand Your Marketing Funnel</h3>\n<p>The marketing funnel is a <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-funnel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">funnel diagram</a> that depicts how customers go through the customer journey.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-170482\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2023/01/Marketing-Strategy-coschedule-marketing-funnel.png\" alt=\"CoSchedule's marketing funnel \" width=\"1360\" height=\"1135\" srcset=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2023/01/Marketing-Strategy-coschedule-marketing-funnel.png 1360w, https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2023/01/Marketing-Strategy-coschedule-marketing-funnel-300x250.png 300w, https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2023/01/Marketing-Strategy-coschedule-marketing-funnel-770x643.png 770w, https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2023/01/Marketing-Strategy-coschedule-marketing-funnel-768x641.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" /></p>\n<p>Prospective consumers, like sales funnels, begin at the top when they become aware of a need. They then examine items that satisfy that demand before making a purchase.</p>\n<h3>Define Your Marketing Channels</h3>\n<p>Any technique or platform used to advertise a product or service to customers is considered a <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-channels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing channel</a>. The fundamental objective is to transfer the product or service ownership from the manufacturer to the consumer.</p>\n<h3>Choose Your Marketing Tactics</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-tactics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marketing tactics</a> are the actions used to drive the promotion of a product or service to achieve specified marketing objectives.</p>\n<p>A case study is an example of a marketing approach. Blog articles, white papers, and videos are examples of material that may be used to implement that marketing technique.</p>\n<h2>Step 6: Execute &amp; Publish Marketing Activities</h2>\n<h3>Marketing Calendar</h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-calendar-template\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marketing calendar</a> is a tool that allows you to plan and organize all of your marketing efforts in one location.

Marketing Plan?</h2>\n<p>Is a marketing strategy the same as a marketing plan?</p>\n<p>Marketing strategy is your purpose; it is the offering you supply, the method you deliver it, and why your marketing efforts will assist you in achieving your company’s mission and strategic goals. Having a clearly defined marketing strategy is critical for your business’s success.</p>\n<p>A marketing plan, guided by your strategy, is the implementation, the roadmap for tactical marketing actions that assist you in achieving your marketing goals.

A Marketing Tactic?</h2>\n<p>Your marketing strategy defines your objective; it is the product or service you provide, how you give it, and why your marketing efforts will aid you in reaching your company’s mission and strategic goals. While many people see marketing as a hobby, having a well-defined marketing plan is vital to your business’s success.</p>\n<p>Marketing tactics are the more specific methods to achieve the strategy’s objectives. While the process is long-term, tactics are more immediate and focused on a particular goal. Tactics complement strategy by conveying risks, successes, and failures.</p>\n<h2>What Is The Best Marketing Strategy?</h2>\n<p>The best marketing strategy is the one that will generate the most profitable action for your unique business.
