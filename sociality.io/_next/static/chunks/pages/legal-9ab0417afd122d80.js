On 19 February 2021, the European Commission published its draft decisions on the UK’s adequacy under the GDPR and has found the UK to be adequate. On 14 April 2021, the European Data Protection Board announced that it has adopted its opinion on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions. The European Commission announced that it has adopted the adequacy decision for the UK on 28 June 2021, which allows personal data to flow freely between Europe and the UK. The adequacy decision includes a ‘sunset clause', which means that the decision will automatically expire four years after their entry into force. There will be a new decision if the UK continues to ensure an adequate level of data protection.","Pursuant to the GDPR, in the absence of an adequacy decision, a controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country only if it has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available.
