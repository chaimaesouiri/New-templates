                        <div class="font-inter font-normal text-gray-2 ">According to the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (Art. FINPROV.10A), transfer of personal data from the E.U. countries to the UK was not considered as transfer to a third country until the end of April 2021, which period was extended by two further months or until the date when an adequacy decision in relation to the UK is adopted by the European Commission. On 19 February 2021, the European Commission published its draft decisions on the UK’s adequacy under the GDPR and has found the UK to be adequate. On 14 April 2021, the European Data Protection Board announced that it has adopted its opinion on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions. The European Commission announced that it has adopted the adequacy decision for the UK on 28 June 2021, which allows personal data to flow freely between Europe and the UK. The adequacy decision includes a ‘sunset clause', which means that the decision will automatically expire four years after their entry into force. There will be a new decision if the UK continues to ensure an adequate level of data protection.</div>
                        <div class="font-inter font-normal text-gray-2 ">Pursuant to the GDPR, in the absence of an adequacy decision, a controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country only if it has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available. Such safeguards may be provided for by standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission (“EU SCCs”).</div>
                        <div class="font-inter font-normal text-gray-2 ">The European Commission has adopted the decision 2021/914/EU on 4 June 2021, which provides for modernized standard contractual clauses. These new EU SCCs are not valid for restricted international transfers under UK GDPR.</div>
                        <div class="font-inter font-normal text-gray-2 ">We are allowed to enter into new contracts on the basis of the old EU SCCs until 21 September 2022. It is accepted that all contracts on the basis of the old EU SCCs will continue to provide appropriate safeguards for the purpose of the UK GDPR, until 21 March 2024. From 21 March 2024, to transfer personal data outside of the UK and EU (except for countries which are granted an adequacy decision), we will enter into a contract on the basis of the international data transfer agreement (IDTA) or the international data transfer addendum to the EU SCCc for international data transfers (UK SCCs). We have already concluded data processing agreements and EU SCCs and/or UK SCCs with all the third-party organisations/sub-processors, which may transfer your data outside of the EU.</div>
